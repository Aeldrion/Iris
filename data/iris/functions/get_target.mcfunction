#> iris:get_target
#
# Returns the position of the block targeted
# To tell where a player is looking, anchoring to the eye position is needed: execute as <player> at @s anchored eyes positioned ^ ^ ^ run function iris:get_target
# Targeted block/entity information is sent to storage (see output below) but a marker with tag 'iris.ray' is also present in the targeted block after running this function

# @public
# @context an entity, their eye position, and their rotation

#       TargetEntities: byte
#           Whether or not to look for entities
#           Defaults to false
#       MaxRecursionDepth: int
#           How many blocks to traverse before giving up
#           Defaults to 16
#       Blacklist: string
#           A block or a block tag to ignore

#       The distance (in Âµm) travelled by the ray before it hits a block

# @output
#   Result: The distance (in blocks, rounded up) before an obstacle is hit, 0 if no block or entity is found
#   Success: 1 if a block or entity was hit, 0 otherwise
